## Folder: physical-flume

* `physical-lab-water-depth.xlsx` detailed recordings of the water depth measured in the physical lab flume, with timestamps.
* `physical-lab-velocities.xlsx` post-processed velocity measurements for Q30, MQ, and HQ100, with timestamps.

## Folder: pictures

Pictures taken during the experiments. Note that no pictures were taken during the MQ experiment (videos only). The pictures are mostly aimed at visually describing the experimental setup and measurement equipment.

## Folder: videos

Videos shot during the experiments, including slow-motion videos from the slots.

## Acknowledgements

The experiments were conducted at the Hydraulic Laboratory of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. The staff and head of the laboratory, Stefan Haun, and the head of the department, Silke Wieprecht, are thanked for making the experiments possible.
